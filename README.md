## Introduction to Agentic Design Patterns

Agentic design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered when designing and implementing intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. These patterns provide established best practices, architectural guidelines, and strategic approaches to ensure agents can communicate effectively, coordinate tasks, negotiate resources, and adapt to dynamic environments.

### Key Concepts

- **Autonomy:** Agents operate independently and make decisions without human intervention.
- **Proactivity:** Agents take initiative and act to achieve goals rather than just react to events.
- **Reactivity:** Agents respond to changes in their environment in real time.
- **Social Ability:** Agents interact, negotiate, and collaborate with other agents to achieve shared objectives.
- **Adaptability:** Agents can adjust their behavior based on feedback, learning, or environmental changes.

### Why Use Agentic Design Patterns?

- **Scalability:** Manage the complexity of growing agent networks.
- **Modularity:** Reuse design elements across different projects.
- **Efficiency:** Streamline communication and task distribution, reducing computational overhead.
- **Maintainability:** Clear patterns simplify debugging, updates, and scaling.
- **Interoperability:** Ensure agents can seamlessly communicate using standardized protocols.

### Common Agentic Design Patterns

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Observer Pattern: Agents monitor events and react to changes.
- Strategy Pattern: Enables agents to switch between decision-making strategies dynamically.

**Structural Patterns:**
- Composite Pattern: Organizes agents hierarchically to manage complex tasks.
- Proxy Pattern: Controls access to other agents or resources.

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Mediator Pattern: Centralizes communication between agents to avoid tight coupling.
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Distributes tasks across agents in a structured way.
