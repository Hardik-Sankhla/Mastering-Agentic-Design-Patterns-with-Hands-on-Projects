## 🤖 What is an Intelligent Agent?

An **intelligent agent** is a software or hardware entity that:

- **Perceives** its environment
- **Makes decisions**
- **Acts** to achieve specific goals

These agents operate **autonomously**, adapt to dynamic environments, and often **collaborate** with other agents or systems.
