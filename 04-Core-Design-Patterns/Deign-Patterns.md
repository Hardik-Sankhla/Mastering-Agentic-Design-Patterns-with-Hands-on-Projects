# 🌟 Core Design Patterns in Agentic Systems

Welcome!  
This module explores **core design patterns** in agentic systems, focusing on behavioral, structural, and interaction patterns. These patterns are foundational for building scalable, adaptable, and maintainable multi-agent systems.

---

## 🧠 1. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns define **how agents act and respond to events or stimuli** within their environment, and how they interact with other agents. They provide reusable solutions for managing agent behavior, ensuring consistency, scalability, and adaptability in complex systems.

### 🤔 What Are Behavioral Patterns?

- **Modular & Reusable:** Encapsulate agent behaviors for reuse and maintainability.
- **Efficient Interaction:** Reduce code duplication and ensure predictable agent interactions.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Enable agents to react to environmental changes in real time.
- **Key Use Case:** Multi-agent systems (MAS) where agents must make decisions and adapt quickly.

---

### 🏆 Key Behavioral Patterns

#### 👀 Observer Pattern

**Purpose:**  
Allows one agent (the *subject*) to notify other agents (*observers*) about changes in its state, without tight coupling.

**How It Works:**
1. Subject maintains a list of observers.
2. On state change, subject notifies all observers.
3. Observers react accordingly.

**Characteristics:**
- **One-to-many dependency:** A single state change affects multiple observers.
- **Decoupled design:** Observers are independent of the subject’s internal logic.
- **Event-driven:** Triggered by specific events or state changes.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Stock price monitoring: Agents observe price changes and trigger buy/sell actions.
- Weather monitoring: Sensors (subjects) notify response agents about weather changes.

#### 🧭 Strategy Pattern

**Purpose:**  
Enables an agent to switch between different behavior algorithms dynamically based on changing conditions.

**How It Works:**
1. Agent maintains a reference to a strategy object.
2. Different strategies define specific behavior algorithms.
3. Agent switches strategies at runtime.

**Characteristics:**
- **Encapsulates multiple algorithms:** Promotes flexibility.
- **Decouples behavior logic:** Keeps main agent logic clean.

**Example Use Cases:**
- E-commerce pricing: Agents switch between discount-based and demand-based pricing.
- Game AI: Characters switch between attack and defend modes based on health.

## 🏗️ 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns focus on **how agents and their components are organized and interconnected** to ensure efficient communication, task distribution, and resource sharing.

### 🏛️ What Are Structural Patterns?

- **Composition & Organization:** Define agent hierarchies and relationships.
- **Collaboration:** Ensure agents work together to achieve complex objectives.
- **Resource Optimization:** Minimize communication overhead and optimize resource usage.
- **Key Use Case:** Large-scale MAS with frequent agent interactions.

---

### 🏆 Key Structural Patterns

#### 🌳 Composite Pattern

**Purpose:**  
Organizes agents into tree-like hierarchical structures, treating individual agents and groups uniformly.

**How It Works:**
- **Leaf agents:** Perform specific tasks.
- **Composite agents:** Group multiple agents and delegate tasks.
- **Hierarchy:** Composite agents may contain other composites, forming recursive structures.

**Characteristics:**
- **Complex hierarchies:** Supports scalability.
- **Uniform treatment:** Individual and group agents are handled consistently.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Smart factories: Agents managing machines grouped under supervisory agents.
- Robotic swarms: Drones grouped into sub-swarms managed by leader agents.

#### 🛡️ Proxy Pattern

**Purpose:**  
Provides a stand-in or placeholder agent to control access to another agent or resource.

**How It Works:**
- **Proxy agent:** Acts as intermediary for requests.
- **Access control:** Manages sensitive or resource-intensive tasks.

**Characteristics:**
- **Security:** Acts as gatekeeper.
- **Resource optimization:** Handles requests locally before passing on.
- **Lazy initialization:** Resources accessed only when needed.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Database access: Proxy agents optimize query requests.
- Secure API gateways: Agents act as intermediaries for secure data access.

| **Scalability**| High                            | Moderate                           |
| **Resource**   | Distributed                     | Controlled by proxy                |
| **Best Use**   | Multi-level systems             | Secure/resource-heavy tasks        |

## 🤝 3. Interaction Patterns

Interaction patterns define **how agents communicate, coordinate, and collaborate** to achieve shared objectives. They ensure efficient, structured, and conflict-free agent-to-agent interactions.

### 💬 What Are Interaction Patterns?

- **Scalability:** Support large numbers of interacting agents.

---

### 🏆 Key Interaction Patterns

#### 🧑‍⚖️ Mediator Pattern

**Purpose:**  
Introduces a central coordinating agent that manages communication between multiple agents, preventing tight coupling.

**How It Works:**
- Agents communicate via the mediator.
- Mediator routes messages and delegates tasks.

**Characteristics:**
- **Centralized coordination:** One agent oversees communication.
- **Decoupling:** Agents remain independent.
- **Reduced complexity:** Simplifies communication paths.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Air traffic control: Central controller manages airplane communication.
- Chat applications: Server mediates user messages.

#### 🔗 Chain of Responsibility Pattern

**Purpose:**  
Passes a request or task along a chain of agents, each with the opportunity to handle or pass it forward.

**How It Works:**
- Task passes from agent to agent in order.
- Each agent decides to handle or pass the task.

**Characteristics:**
- **Decentralized handling:** No single agent controls the flow.
- **Flexible:** Different agents handle different tasks.
- **Scalable:** Adding agents doesn’t disrupt the chain.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Technical support: Tickets pass through support levels.
- Logistics: Packages move through checkpoints.

| **Control**    | Centralized                    | Decentralized                     |
| **Focus**      | Communication management       | Task delegation                   |
| **Scalability**| Limited by mediator            | Scales with chain length          |
| **Dependency** | High on mediator               | Distributed among agents          |
| **Best Use**   | Multi-agent coordination       | Task distribution                 |
